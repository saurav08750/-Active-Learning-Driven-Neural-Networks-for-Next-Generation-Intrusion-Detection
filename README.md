# Active-Learning-Driven-Neural-Networks-for-Next-Generation-Intrusion-Detection
In this project, implemented Traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and ANN with Active Learning. Utilized the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which includes modern network traffic data and used SMOTE to overcome data imbalance problem. It is Found that ANN with Active Learning outperforms the Traditional ANN with an accuracy of 99%. Active learning driven-ANN takes less labeled data for training and also enhances the detection capabilities of the intrusion detection.
